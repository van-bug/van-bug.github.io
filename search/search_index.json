VanBUG Monthly Event \u00b6 Event Details Date/Time: Thursday, January 16th, 2025 11:00am - 12:30pm PT Location: Remote Join Zoom Meeting https://sfu.zoom.us/j/82777232230?pwd=KDY7saEuetZX9l3XvGZTqpYFQfplrq.1 Meeting ID: 827 7723 2230 Password: 032600 Featured Speaker : Dr. Graeme Koelwyn Talk Title: Inflammatory memory: using \u2018omics tools to illuminate new pathobiology in heart disease Affiliation: SFU, Assistant Professor with the Department of Health Sciences, Canada Research Chair Tier II in Public Health 'Omics in Exercise and Disease Bio: Dr. Graeme Koelwyn is the Dr. James Hogg Chair in Public Health \u2018Omics in Exercise and Disease at St Paul\u2019s Hospital and an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. He received his PhD in Pathobiology and Translational Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in 2019. He then completed his postdoctoral training at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He joined SFU and HLI in 2021. The overarching goal of the Koelwyn lab is to apply a translational, \u2018omics-based approach for understanding how heart, lung and/or oncologic diseases communicate with each other through immune-specific mechanisms, leading to adverse systemic, tissue, and cellular responses. It also seeks to demonstrate how exercise \u2013 a low-cost public health strategy \u2013 can therapeutically improve immune function to protect from these diseases and their deleterious interactions. Abstract: A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Canada, with over 60,000 Canadians entering emergency rooms annually. The recovery from a heart attack requires a swift and coordinated response from our innate immune system, which responds to inflammatory signals generated by the infarct. Historically, it was believed this immune response, coordinated by monocytes and macrophages to clear debris and heal damaged tissue, had no lasting effect on the immune system. However, recent evidence from our group and others have shown this is not the case. In this talk, I\u2019ll discuss the recently developed concept of inflammatory memory, wherein monocytes and macrophages acquire \u2018learned\u2019 behavior following inflammatory events such as a heart attack, via epigenetic modifications, which result in long-term altered responses to subsequent immune challenges. I\u2019ll also discuss the \u2018omics tools used to identify heart attack-induced inflammatory memory, and the effect of such memory on future disease risk.

Affiliation: Biochemistry and Microbiology, UVic URL: http://web.uvic.ca/~cupton/ Presentation: Download Talk summary: Poxviruses are large complex viruses containing ds DNA genomes (150-320kb) that encode more than 200 proteins. More than 30 genomes have been sequenced. Despite significant efforts we still don\u2019t know which proteins are responsible for the virulent phenotype of smallpox in comparison to the vaccine strain vaccinia virus. Also, of the 80 genes present in every orthopoxvirus, 20% are of unknown function. We have developed several programs designed to organize the poxvirus genome data in SQL databases and analyze the data at the level of the genome as well as the gene. Our focus has been on providing easy-to-use tools that allow the molecular virologist to make full use of the available sequence data. The tools can be thought of as catalysts for sequence analysis. The Viral Genome Organizer (VGO) and Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters (POCs) are JAVA client-server applications that access an updated database containing all complete poxvirus genomes. This architecture permits support of a wide variety of platforms and removes the problem of providing database and software updates to many users. Orthologous genes are automatically grouped into families based on BLASTP scores and assessed by a human database curator. POCs permits complex SQL queries to retrieve interesting groups of DNA and protein sequences as well as gene families for subsequent interrogation by a variety of integrated tools: BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTN, Jalview (multiple alignment), Dotlet (Dotplot), Laj (local alignment), and NAP (nucleotide to amino acid alignment). The POCs database stores 1) a corrected version of the data provided in the GenBank file for complete poxvirus genomes and 2) annotations, ORFs, MW, PI, nucleotide and amino acid (aa) frequencies, codon use, BLASTP scores, and orthologous cluster membership data for each gene. VGO is used to interact with the genome sequences via a GUI.

Affiliation: Biochemistry and Microbiology, UVic URL: http://web.uvic.ca/~cupton/ Presentation: Download Talk summary: Poxviruses are large complex viruses containing ds DNA genomes (150-320kb) that encode more than 200 proteins. More than 30 genomes have been sequenced. Despite significant efforts we still don\u2019t know which proteins are responsible for the virulent phenotype of smallpox in comparison to the vaccine strain vaccinia virus. Also, of the 80 genes present in every orthopoxvirus, 20% are of unknown function. We have developed several programs designed to organize the poxvirus genome data in SQL databases and analyze the data at the level of the genome as well as the gene. Our focus has been on providing easy-to-use tools that allow the molecular virologist to make full use of the available sequence data. The tools can be thought of as catalysts for sequence analysis. The Viral Genome Organizer (VGO) and Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters (POCs) are JAVA client-server applications that access an updated database containing all complete poxvirus genomes. This architecture permits support of a wide variety of platforms and removes the problem of providing database and software updates to many users. Orthologous genes are automatically grouped into families based on BLASTP scores and assessed by a human database curator. POCs permits complex SQL queries to retrieve interesting groups of DNA and protein sequences as well as gene families for subsequent interrogation by a variety of integrated tools: BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTN, Jalview (multiple alignment), Dotlet (Dotplot), Laj (local alignment), and NAP (nucleotide to amino acid alignment). The POCs database stores 1) a corrected version of the data provided in the GenBank file for complete poxvirus genomes and 2) annotations, ORFs, MW, PI, nucleotide and amino acid (aa) frequencies, codon use, BLASTP scores, and orthologous cluster membership data for each gene. VGO is used to interact with the genome sequences via a GUI. Preprocessed BLAST (BLASTP and PSI-BLAST) searches (updated monthly) for all proteins against the NR protein database and EST database (TBLASTN) are available.

The PANTHER Protein Classification was developed to associate proteins and their genes with protein families and biological ontology terms (molecular functions and biological processes), linking sequence with function. It is based on expert biologist curation of protein families, such that functional divergence events (subfamilies) are captured as statistical models. This allows not only classification of proteins of known function, but also accurate functional inferences for uncharacterized proteins (View PubMed abstracts ). The PANTHER project was initiated nearly five years ago, and I will discuss the philosophy and lessons that have driven the course of its development. I will also briefly discuss some examples of using the concise set of PANTHER functional categories to analyze large gene sets, such as the set of genes that show evidence of human lineage-specific selection since the last common ancestor with the chimpanzee. Further, these statistical models can be used to predict the likely functional impact of a missense SNP.

Because the mapping of disease-causing variants requires the coinheritance of the marker and the functional allele, the main motivation for the HapMap is to assess the strength of allelic association along human chromosomes. This is accomplished by genotyping, at millions of polymorphic sites, sets of reference samples from a handful of large world populations, and annotating measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype diversity within these samples. Although most polymorphisms are shared among all human populations, there are significant differences in their allele frequencies. Additionally, the strength of allelic association may not only vary between samples of different ethnic origins, but also across consecutive sets drawn from even a single population. Therefore, the utility of the HapMap resource for clinical association studies will largely depend on the degree to which the annotations based on the reference individuals are generalizable for consecutive, clinical samples. In this talk we will discuss the basic concepts and algorithms used in the analysis of multi-locus haplotypes: experimental haplotype determination, statistical methods of haplotype inference / reconstruction from diploid genotype data, pair-wise LD-based and haplotype-based measures of allelic association, haplotype and LD block extraction. We will show how SNP discovery and the selection of SNPs for inclusion into the HapMap have shaped the sampling properties of this extensive and expensive genotype resource. Finally, along the lines of our primary research interests, we demonstrate how quantitative models of long term demographic history, a major determinant of differential allele structure among geographically subdivided populations, can be used both to analyze the association properties of the HapMap reference samples, and to predict the strength of allelic association for additional, future samples, such as those that will be used in clinical case-control studies. \u2014 Student Speaker: Jenn Gardy Title of talk: Updates from the Protein Localization Prediction Front: PSORTb, PSORTdb and Perspectives on Predictive Methods Affiliation: SFU Brinkman Laboratory URL: http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/brinkman/index.html Presentation: Download This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License .","title":"Sep - Gabor Marth"},{"location":"archive/2004/2004-09-09/#sep-gabor-marth","text":"Speaker : Gabor Marth Title of talk: The utility of the HapMap reference samples for clinical populations Event Details Date: September 9th, 2004 Affiliation: Boston College URL: http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/biology/facadmin/marth/ Presentation: Download Abstract: A kilobase-scale map of human polymorphism structure, the HapMap, is under construction to help us understand the molecular and demographic forces that have shaped the variation landscape of our species and to identify from millions of polymorphic sites the small subset with functional effects.

Event Details Date: October 14, 2004 Affiliation: The Blueprint Initiative Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto URL: http://www.blueprint.org/research/research_pi.html Abstract: Mechanistic knowledge has been transformed from static pictures of pathways and reactions to new databases of interactions, complexes and pathways. This information is critically important for the further elucidation of the mechanisms of life and disease, yet it is filled with experimental uncertainties and high rates of false information. We have recently been trying to untangle the possible physical interactions in S. cerevisiae starting from high-throughput experiments defining molecular complexes and interactions from tagged pull-down and yeast-two-hybrid methods. Four areas of informatics research have begun to bear fruit. First, we have undertaken to analyze and report domain-domain correlations to better understand the underlying makeup of protein complexes. When protein complex networks are simplified into domain-domain correlations, the overlap between different experimental datasets improves. Second, we have developed methods to define and predict specific domain-motif interactions in protein complexes in yeast. In particular, more domain-motif interactions are found in low-affinity purification methods (FLAG-tag) than in high-affinity methods (TAP-tag), although this observation may be bait-biased. Third, we have been attempting to build tools to understand and annotate the physical interconnections between protein domains and their small molecule binding sites through the Small Molecule Interaction Database (SMID). SMID works with and a variant of RPS-BLAST, enhanced to locate small molecule binding sites based on PDB 3D structure and NCBI CDD information. And finally, we have developed a SVM based score called BIND-PICKS (Protein Interaction Confidence Kernel Scores) which will form the basis for reporting on the quality of yeast physical interactions. About 18% of all high-throughput data (complexes as spoke models) scores above the false positive threshold with BIND-PICKS.

Now a Genome Canada funded project, it has been two years since the first prototypes were made public, and one year since a stable API, supporting code, and messaging layer standards were released. Public BioMOBY services (MOBY-S) are currently being provided by more than 20 independent institutions worldwide, and the platform has been adopted by several high-profile international consortia. With the collaboration of the UK myGrid consortium, a client application is now available that is capable of discovering and executing MOBY services singly, or in manually or automatically constructed pipelines. Taverna thus represents the first fully-featured MOBY client program, and its success indicates that the spread of MOBY will now begin to hasten. Given these events, and given the parallel development of competing technologies such as myGrid, it is now appropriate to step back and evaluate what BioMOBY does, how it does it, what are the successes and failures in the BioMOBY approach, and what direction it should take over the next three years.

Now a Genome Canada funded project, it has been two years since the first prototypes were made public, and one year since a stable API, supporting code, and messaging layer standards were released. Public BioMOBY services (MOBY-S) are currently being provided by more than 20 independent institutions worldwide, and the platform has been adopted by several high-profile international consortia. With the collaboration of the UK myGrid consortium, a client application is now available that is capable of discovering and executing MOBY services singly, or in manually or automatically constructed pipelines. Taverna thus represents the first fully-featured MOBY client program, and its success indicates that the spread of MOBY will now begin to hasten. Given these events, and given the parallel development of competing technologies such as myGrid, it is now appropriate to step back and evaluate what BioMOBY does, how it does it, what are the successes and failures in the BioMOBY approach, and what direction it should take over the next three years. Though the system will be demoed at this presentaiton, the talk will focus primarily on the theoretical aspects of web service interoperability, and explore the nature of the interoperability and integration problems in the context of the BioMOBY solution.

The problem at hand is hierarchical in nature, with the hierarchy spanning many levels. Each of these levels can be thought of as comprising multiple active agents that are diverse in their nature (e.g. genes, proteins, pathways, organelles, etc) and also in their behavior. It is within this setting that one seeks to build an integrated view of the system under study, as soon as the relevant units and the complex inter- and intra-level relationships in which these units participate have been characterized. Implicit in the above outline are the following assumptions: a complete, and, presumably correct list of parts exists for the system that is being studied; and, most, if not all, of the important relationships involving these parts are available. Through the research work of my group and of others, there is increasing evidence that the situation is likely to be more complicated than initially estimated, and that one should be watchful when it comes to making or relying on the above two assumptions. In this presentation, I will describe several examples of parts and relationships that have emerged from our most recent research work on gene discovery, horizontal gene transfer, the de novo design of antimicrobial peptides, and the study of the RNA interference phenomenon. These results suggest that the one-dimensional sequence space continues to remain a source of excitement and likely possesses many more properties that have yet to be discovered.

Starting with a set of co-expressed and orthologous genes and building on the assumption that these sets of genes are activated by the same set of transcription factor, the cisRed pipeline runs a number of motif detection pipelines in parallel to identify those motifs shared by the upstream regions of these genes.

Abstract: When we think of bioinformatics we often think of its applications to large biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. However, it is important to remember that the genes and proteins in cells are all polymers of small molecules. Not only are small molecules important in the synthesis and maintenance of DNA, RNA and proteins, they are also vital to the regulation of genes, enzymes and the general cellular environment. It is little wonder, then, that 99% of all FDA approved drugs are small molecules. So clearly small molecules are important. But why are they so often left out of most bioinformatics databases and bioinformatics software tools? Why is there so little integration of small molecule (chemical) data with large molecule (gene/protein) data? In this presentation I will provide a brief overview of the recent attempts that bioinformaticians are now making to integrate chemical information (cheminformatics) with biological information (bioinformatics). I will highlight some of the newly developed databases (PubChem, BIND, KEGG) that are at least partially dedicated to small molecule/large molecule integration. I will also describe some of the work going on my lab aimed at developing several newly integrated databases including DrugBank, CytP450-Free, and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). Finally I will discuss efforts we are undertaking to model metabolism and small-molecule mediated events in the cell through our newly developed cellular simulation software called SimCell.

At the same time, high throughput technologies are delineating the location, abundance, state, and interactions of genes and their products with increasing resolution in terms of cell types, time points and conditions. A recent phenomenon accompanying the reconstruction of large-scale molecular interaction maps is the publication of often unfathomably large network diagrams.

At the same time, high throughput technologies are delineating the location, abundance, state, and interactions of genes and their products with increasing resolution in terms of cell types, time points and conditions. A recent phenomenon accompanying the reconstruction of large-scale molecular interaction maps is the publication of often unfathomably large network diagrams.

An important task toward this goal is the discovery of regulatory modules, consisting of a regulatory program, in particular a set of transcription factors, and a corresponding set of co-regulated genes. Genes can have different regulatory programs in different experimental conditions such as tissues and developmental stage, which implies that genes may not be co-regulated in all experimental conditions observed in comprehensive expression data sets. This has motivated the development of subspace clustering (biclustering) methods that find clusters of genes that have similar expression patterns in subsets of the set of all conditions. We present the KiWi algorithm, a novel subspace clustering algorithm that scales much better to large and high-dimensional datasets than existing algorithms. Different high-throughput d! ata such as cDNA microarrays, protein-protein interaction data and ChIP-Seq data reflect only partial information of the biological system from different points of view, and none of them can alone accurately reconstruct a regulatory network. Therefore, integrated approaches incorporating different types of experimental data are required. We propose a new approach to module discovery based on interaction network and expression data, finding dense subnetworks of genes that are co-expressed in large enough subspaces. The talk concludes with the discussion of future research directions.

The accomplishment of the Human Genome Projects and success of many subsequent advances in genomics have made it possible to examine the expression and function of many genes simultaneously. However, the availability of these data sets and resources has not provided immediate insight into the mechanisms underlying our lives, nor has it provided cures to numerous devastating diseases.

The accomplishment of the Human Genome Projects and success of many subsequent advances in genomics have made it possible to examine the expression and function of many genes simultaneously. However, the availability of these data sets and resources has not provided immediate insight into the mechanisms underlying our lives, nor has it provided cures to numerous devastating diseases.

Identifying the human sequence variation that makes up the genetic basis of common disease will have a tremendous impact on medicine in many ways. Recent efforts to identify these genetic factors through large scale association studies which compare information on variation between a set of healthy and diseased individuals have been remarkably successful. However, despite the success of these initial studies, many challenges and open questions remain on how to design and analyze the results of association studies. In this talk, I will formulate association study design as an optimization problem where the goal is to design a study which maximizes the statistical power to detect genetic risk factors given a fixed budget. I will demonstrate how we can leverage the inherent correlation structure of variation in the human genome to design efficient association studies.

Event Details Date/Time: December 11, 2008, 6:00pm Affiliation: University of British Columbia, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Biomedical Signal and Image Computing Laboratory URL: Martin McKeown Abstract: Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in Canada, after Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Although treatments (both medical and surgical) are available for PD, and can have dramatic beneficial effects especially early in the disease, they treat the symptoms of the disease without altering the overall progression. Using fMRI, we can non-invasively probe the normal and parkinsonian brain, but the data require extensive processing to get meaningful results. We will discuss the roles of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBNs), Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM), replicator dynamics, as well as 3D moment invariants in the analysis of these data sets. Additionally, we will describe how second order linear dynamical system theory can be applied to manual tracking data from PD and normal subjects. Finally, since recent research has demonstrated that functionally, the Parkinsonian state is characterized by the emergence of pathological oscillations in the beta range (12-30 Hz) within basal ganglia / cortical loops, we will describe how frequency-domain analysis, such as partial directed coherence (PDC) can be used to investigate the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from PD subjects. These technologies will be put in the context of exploring compensatory mechanisms in PD, capable of ameliorating overall disability.

These interactions are difficult to experimentally map, thus it would be ideal if they could be predicted directly from the genome sequence. Unfortunately, this is not currently possible. Interestingly, a significant fraction of these are protein-protein interactions mediated by peptide recognition modules reused in different combinations to create many proteins with different functions. These domains are relatively easy to detect in genes, through sequence similarity to known family members. A complete specificity map of peptide recognition preferences for all of these domains would enable accurate prediction for a significant subset of protein-protein interactions directly from the genome. Advances in DNA sequencing, phage display and protein chips, have led to large-scale binding preference mapping for some of these domains and expression and localization profiles that map when and where a given protein may exist in a specific cell type are also available. We are developing computational methods to combine and use this data to accurately predict biologically relevant protein interactions involving PDZ, WW and SH3 domains for experimental validation directly from a genome sequence. This will contribute to the understanding of diverse cell signaling networks, will reduce the effort required to map molecular interaction networks, will enable de novo network engineering using synthetic biology methods and will allow accurate prediction of the functional consequence of genetic mutations associated with disease.

A systematic understanding of the genetic and molecular determinants of cancers has already begun to have a transformative effect on the study and treatment of cancer, particularly through the identification of a range of genetic alterations in protein kinase genes, which are highly associated with the disease. Since kinases are prominent therapeutic targets for intervention within the cancer cell, studying the impact that genomic alterations within them have on cancer initiation, progression, and treatment is both logical and timely.

Examples will be shown illustrating how we have applied the various tools to support both the discovery of clinical relevant cell populations and aid in patient diagnosis.

Since the number of data points produced by NGS experiments is in the billions, variant discovery is necessarily a computational exercise. I will describe the development of novel computational methods for the discovery of mutations from NGS, based on probabilistic models.

We have studied the transcriptome-wide distribution of expression levels in mouse T helper cells using RNA-seq technology, and have developed a variety of ways to model the expected background levels. This is critical for definition of a threshold level of expression of a gene in a given cell type. In order to calibrate the RNA-seq expression levels in terms of molecules of mRNA per cell, we have integrated the RNA-seq data with single molecule mRNA-FISH experiments. The results of these analyses and experiments show that many genes are expressed at > ~ 1 molecule per cell and that two major expression levels can be identified which vary by roughly one to two orders of magnitude. This gives rise to bimodal distributions of gene expression levels in cell populations.

The metabolic potential of an organism or community can be inferred from primary sequence information with the aid of computational methods that assemble or cluster contiguous reads, search for patterns or motifs representing genes, and reconstruct metabolic pathways based on known biochemical rules. One of the emerging concepts in environmental genomic data analysis is the distributed nature of metabolic transformations mediated by diverse microbial partners linked together in syntrophic or substrate dependency relationships. Understanding how distributed metabolic networks link microbial activity with biogeochemical cycles has emerged as a fundamental scientific problem guiding the peer efforts of scientists and engineers around the world. Although, new sequencing technologies are rapidly expanding our capacity to explore the microcosm, there are a number of computational and analytical challenges that limit full data utilization and interpretation. Here we explore the development of a novel analytic pipeline that adopts Pathway Tools ( http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/ptools-overview.html ) to metabolic reconstruction of microbial community interaction networks. Pathway Tools is a reusable, production-quality software environment for creating and managing pathway/genome databases (PGDBs) and predicting metabolic pathway interaction networks for these PGDBs using a highly curated database of metabolic pathways and components representing all domains of life (MetaCyc).

He is a computational biologist whose doctoral training was in machine learning at MIT and the Gatsby Unit in London. His lab uses statistical learning to make biological discoveries. Right now, he is interested in post-transcriptional regulation, automated prediction of gene function, and understanding cancer (and other complex diseases) using genomics. URL: Quaid Morris Abstract: RNA-binding domains are among the most common domains in eukaryotic genomes and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play critical roles in post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) of gene expression by regulating mRNA processing, mRNA translation, mRNA export and mRNA stability. Many RBPs bind in a sequence-specific manner however, their sequencing binding preferences alone are insufficient to uniquely identify their targets. As a first step towards building quantitative models of PTR, we are mapping out mRNA and RBP interactions using a combined biochemical and computational strategy. Our strategy is based on a microarray-based assay, called RNAcompete, that measures the binding affinity of a recombinant RBP for hundreds of thousands of short RNA sequences. These sequences are designed to comprehensively query the space of possible binding preferences. We use a new RNA motif finding algorithm, RNAcontext, to infer sequence and structural binding preferences of RBPs from both in vitro RNAcompete data, as well as, in vivo binding data from large-scale immunoprecipation-based assays. Using these motif models to find RBP binding sites on mRNAs requires estimating mRNA secondary structure computationally. I will present some recent work that suggests that estimating this structure is easier than expected. I will also say a few words about the GeneMANIA project. We have collected more than 800 interaction networks for six major model organisms that you can used to analyze and extend gene lists using either a user-interface web interface (http://www.genemania.org) or a Cytoscape plugin. By querying this interaction data using a fast and accurate gene function prediction algorithm, GeneMANIA can tell you how genes in your list are connected to one another, find more genes like those on your list and possibly what type of data you should collect to help extend your list. (GeneMANIA is collaborative work with Gary Bader). Please note: Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths.

I will present some recent work that suggests that estimating this structure is easier than expected. I will also say a few words about the GeneMANIA project. We have collected more than 800 interaction networks for six major model organisms that you can used to analyze and extend gene lists using either a user-interface web interface (http://www.genemania.org) or a Cytoscape plugin. By querying this interaction data using a fast and accurate gene function prediction algorithm, GeneMANIA can tell you how genes in your list are connected to one another, find more genes like those on your list and possibly what type of data you should collect to help extend your list. (GeneMANIA is collaborative work with Gary Bader). Please note: Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths.

Event Details Date/Time: Thursday, December 9, 2010, 6:00 pm Affiliation: Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry , University of British Columbia URL: Todd Woodward Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from one subject typically involves measurement of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in the whole brain, measured every two seconds, over a period of about 12 minutes, at 65,000 brain regions. Over this 12 minute period, participants are asked to repeatedly carry out some cognitive task, for example, to remember 8 numbers for a short period of time (e.g., 4 seconds). Researchers using this technology need to determine which brain networks are invoked in response to the task (and not some other aspect of thinking, like \u201cthis scanner is uncomfortable!\u201d), but also (and importantly), which are differentially involved in the experimental conditions that are built into the task. The method that our laboratory has developed for this purpose is named constrained principal component analysis (fMRI-CPCA), and combines multivariate multiple regression with principal component analysis (i.e., singular value decomposition). Multivariate multiple regression is used to separate the BOLD signal variance into what is predictable from the task and what is not, and singular value decomposition is used to determine the dominant patterns of intercorrelation between the brain regions for each source of BOLD signal variance, thereby forming brain networks. Changes over time in these brain networks can be correlated with the timing of the task to determine their relative involvement in the experimental conditions. fMRI-CPCA is available for download free of charge ( http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fmricpca ).

In this presentation, I will discuss how ancestral DNA sequences can be inferred and how they can be then used to help addressing some key questions in genomics. Reconstructing ancestral sequences poses a number of algorithmic challenges. I will first describe some of our work on aligning orthologous sequence and inferring ancestral sequences, focusing on the accurate identification of insertions and deletions. Next, I will discuss how one can take advantage of the availability of inferred ancestral sequences to help at three important tasks: (i) identify non-coding sites under selection in the human genome; (ii) improve the detection of transcription factor binding sites; and (iii) determine the target gene(s) of long-range enhancers. Evolution has been conducting site-specific functionality assays for hundreds of millions of years.

We have gone from a group of researchers spending years to generated and study one bacterial genome to an individual researcher comparing tens or hundreds of similar genomes at a time with the help of bioinformatic applications. Pangenomic analysis allows us to decipher how a bacterium evolves and how certain small mutations could have a large impact on disease outcome. In recent years, we have also started to sequence the genetic material directly isolated from a microbial community (microbiota) in order to bypass culturing. The International Human Microbiome Consortium and associated efforts are trying to decipher the interactions between our bodies and our microbiotas. The metagenomics approach allows researchers to study an entire microbial community in relation to health and diseases but new challenges arise on how to assign taxonomic and functional information to incomplete and sometimes novel sequences. With the increased scale of sequencing, new bioinformatics and statistical tools are needed to facilitate data process and interpretation. In this talk, I\u2019ll discuss the progress and challenges of microbial genomic analysis with examples drawn from my own research and from literature.

Additionally, I will discuss our new strategy to curate the inference of regulatory interactions from high throughput data using metabolic networks\u2014providing multiple layers of biological context to the problem of regulation.

Clark Abstract: The 1000 Genomes Project has completed its pilot phases including (1) low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals, (2) high-coverage sequencing of two mother\u2013father\u2013child trios; and (3) exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. These data present an unprecedented level of detail about the allele frequency spectrum and local haplotype structure of ~15 million SNPs, 1 M indels, and 20,000 structural variants across the human genome. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes. Data from the two trios produced an estimate of 1028 germline mutations per genome per generation. These data also present an opportunity to test for past signatures of natural selection and demographic effects. In a separate study we examined sequence variation in just two genes from the ARIC cohort study of 13,715 people. This analysis resulted in nearly 4x the expected count of singleton variants which were subsequently confirmed. These data are consistent with a very recent explosive population growth model that matches the historical and archeological record. The data are also consistent with the observation that each new full human genome that is sequenced typically finds upwards of 100,000 novel SNPs that are not yet in any database.

This assumption holds nicely in the case of model organisms, which are usually inbred to reduce haplotypic diversity, and is even not challenged significantly in the case of human samples because of an evolutionarily recent population bottleneck our species experienced. However, when an organism of interest has a diploid genome with a pronounced distance between haplotypes, or when an environmental sample is investigated that represents a collection of similar species, the assumption fails. Furthermore, read lengths of popular high throughput sequencing technologies, and even the spatial associations brought by paired end reads are often not enough to completely de-phase the assembled sequences. In this talk, I will discuss the particular challenges one faces during de novo assembly of such datasets, and describe how we approach to their solution within the ABySS framework. ABySS is a short read assembly tool, particularly developed to address large scale assembly problems. I will introduce how it handles distance information to extend and scaffold contigs, and how it represents haplotypic information in its output. I will demonstrate its performance on the assembly of the mountain pine beetle genome.

In animals, microRNAs (miRNAs) are key actors in controlling protein output. Mature miRNAs are about 22-nucleotide long. They are loaded in RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which bind to miRNA complementary sites in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to repress their translation. Besides, recent studies indicate that various non-coding RNAs control protein output by competitive attraction of miRNAs. I will present an algorithm to predict the microTargetome, i.e. the RISC/mRNA matching, which considers all competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). The model uses a free-energy of hybridization, and an algorithm that mimics miRNA competition and cooperation. Using this algorithm, we simulated the overexpression of single miRNAs in a specific cell line, and derived a series of biological consequences related to such a protein expression control system. MiRNA, ceRNA, and mRNA levels vary in different cell types and states, including cancer cells.

This mutational heterogeneity is apparent on two levels. First, individual cells within a tumor typically have different complements of somatic mutations. Second, different individuals with the same type of cancer often exhibit different combinations of causal, or driver, mutations. We describe algorithms to address both of these sources of heterogeneity. In the first case, we present an algorithm to infer clonal and subclonal copy number aberrations in the presence of admixture by normal (non-cancerous) cells. In the second case, we describe two algorithms to identify driver pathways, groups of genes containing driver mutations, in a large cohort of cancer samples. The first algorithm, HotNet, uses prior information about interactions between genes and identifies subnetworks of a genome-scale interaction network that are recurrently mutated. The second algorithm, Dendrix, optimizes a measure derived from the statistical properties of mutations on driver pathways. We apply these algorithms to genome/exome sequencing and array copy number data from several cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

For this reason, it has been difficult to develop an effective anti-HIV vaccine, as the incoming HIV genome can look very different from one infection to another. The rapid mutation of HIV genomes also causes an infection to proliferate into a highly diverse population within a single patient, and enables the virus to escape the immune system. Recent innovations in genome sequencing technology (known as \u201cnext-generation sequencing\u201d) are providing us with the tools necessary to grapple with the extensive variation of HIV.

The newfound knowledge resulting from meta-analysis of these large data sets continues to spur the development of novel therapeutics and the possibility of repositioning available therapies for off-label applications. As a result, we are quickly approaching an era of personalized medicine in cancer whereby therapeutics may be optimally selected based on each tumour\u2019s unique genetics. To realize this goal, the scientific and medical communities require access to sufficiently sensitive algorithms for identifying somatic mutations and genes relevant to disease such that all potentially \u201cactionable\u201d mutations can be identified in individual tumours, a problem that is currently hindered by tumour heterogeneity and noise inherent in NGS data. Further, such tools must be readily (and freely) available in a framework that enables application by non-specialized individuals including clinicians. This talk will discuss some current state-of-the-art methods for mutation detection and annotation and improvements for increasing detection sensitivity and \u201cdriver\u201d mutation identification.

His research explores the use of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of infectious disease. He has so far used high-throughput sequencing to investigate outbreaks of important bacterial pathogens. He was involved in the crowd-sourced analysis of genomics data from the Shiga-toxin producing E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in Germany. He helped to spark a flurry of crowd-sourced analysis by putting the initial genome assembly on his blog for anyone to access. A more general aim in his group is to develop bioinformatics tools to aid the interpretation of genome and metagenome-scale data in routine clinical practice. Abstract: The ability to reliably reconstruct whole genomes of bacterial strains from mixed samples would enable diagnostic microbiology and environmental applications. I will present CONCOCT, an algorithm and bioinformatics package which uses both composition and read abundance from multiple samples to help assign metagenomics contigs into genome bins. I will show how CONCOCT can used to reconstruct pathogen genomes from a large E. coli outbreak and its use when comparing microbiomes. Short read de novo assembly techniques are limited in their ability to resolve closely related strains and to deal with low coverage genomes. I will discuss how the technique of phylogenetic placement can be used to analyse mixed microbial samples with low coverage, and discuss how new technologies such as Oxford Nanopore, Moleculo and metagenomics Hi-C may continue to transform this field. Please note: Trainees are invited to meet with the VanBUG speaker for open discussion of both science and career paths.

His research explores the use of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of infectious disease. He has so far used high-throughput sequencing to investigate outbreaks of important bacterial pathogens. He was involved in the crowd-sourced analysis of genomics data from the Shiga-toxin producing E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in Germany. He helped to spark a flurry of crowd-sourced analysis by putting the initial genome assembly on his blog for anyone to access. A more general aim in his group is to develop bioinformatics tools to aid the interpretation of genome and metagenome-scale data in routine clinical practice.

Dr. Hirst is the co-chair of the scientific steering committee of the International Human Epigenomics Consortium (IHEC) where he also chairs the IHEC assay standards group. As part of the NIH Reference Human Epigenome and Canadian Epigenetics, Environment and Health Research Consortiums Dr. Hirst has generated and analyzed comprehensive epigenomic profiles from a wide range of normal adult, fetal, embryonic and extraembryonic tissues and purified cell types. He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed papers, primarily in the area of genomics since 1998. Abstract: Mammalian genomes carry non-uniform chemical marks covalently attached to DNA bases and their packaging proteins. These chemical marks, which collectively define the epigenome, interact with cellular transcriptional machinery to establish activity states that reinforce gene activation or silencing. In contrast to the genome, which remains largely the same throughout an individual\u2019s life, the epigenome changes during development and aging, in response to various external stimuli and as diseases emerge. Epigenetic changes (epimutations) are an alternative mechanism to genetic mutation by which oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes may be deregulated within a cancer cell. Such changes are prevalent in many cancer types, and their appearance may precede genetic changes in pre-malignant cells and promote the accumulation of additional damaging genetic and epigenetic lesions. Epimutations are potentially reversible and thus provide a therapeutic opportunity not readily available in the context of somatic genetic lesions. Recent technological advancements have enabled the reproducible assessment of epigenomic marks across the entire genome of human cells and large-scale international efforts are now underway to generate high-resolution reference epigenome maps to accelerate the scientific exploitation of human epigenomic information. The epigenome maps thus generated integrate detailed DNA methylation, histone modification, nucleosome occupancy and coding and non-coding RNA expression in different normal and disease cell types, with the goal of providing new insights into many diseases, including cancer and the discovery of new means to control them.

I will discuss an epidemiological model of the joint epidemic of tuberculosis and HIV in South Africa as an example of the kind of tools policymakers had at their disposal until recently. I will then go on to show how genotypic information can be harnessed to interrogate an epidemic, using the example of complex tuberculosis infections. I will conclude with a mechanistic model that describes the way bacterial pathogens may evolve resistance to drugs, and finally sketch a unified multiscale model that could one day provide new insights into the nature of infectious disease epidemics. Bio: My connection with bioinformatics started in my undergraduate years, when I did my first research project \u2013 and published my first paper \u2013 with Mathieu Blanchette at McGill University. I continued working in this field in graduate school under Bonnie Berger, and acquired expertise in the analysis of biological networks, at the interface of computational and systems biology. After a brief foray into the pharmaceutical industry, where I developed a platform for the analysis of various omics data, I returned to academia. My postdoctoral fellowship focused on a new area of application \u2013 epidemiology \u2013 and I became an expert in the rapidly developing field of molecular epidemiology, the study of epidemics through the prism of the information contained in the genomes of infectious disease-causing pathogens. My current work encompasses all of these subfields and focuses on infectious diseases. I really enjoy working with talented students and forming collaborations to explore various aspects of infectious diseases, ranging from their molecular biology all the way to population-level health policies.

I will discuss an epidemiological model of the joint epidemic of tuberculosis and HIV in South Africa as an example of the kind of tools policymakers had at their disposal until recently. I will then go on to show how genotypic information can be harnessed to interrogate an epidemic, using the example of complex tuberculosis infections. I will conclude with a mechanistic model that describes the way bacterial pathogens may evolve resistance to drugs, and finally sketch a unified multiscale model that could one day provide new insights into the nature of infectious disease epidemics. Bio: My connection with bioinformatics started in my undergraduate years, when I did my first research project \u2013 and published my first paper \u2013 with Mathieu Blanchette at McGill University. I continued working in this field in graduate school under Bonnie Berger, and acquired expertise in the analysis of biological networks, at the interface of computational and systems biology. After a brief foray into the pharmaceutical industry, where I developed a platform for the analysis of various omics data, I returned to academia. My postdoctoral fellowship focused on a new area of application \u2013 epidemiology \u2013 and I became an expert in the rapidly developing field of molecular epidemiology, the study of epidemics through the prism of the information contained in the genomes of infectious disease-causing pathogens. My current work encompasses all of these subfields and focuses on infectious diseases. I really enjoy working with talented students and forming collaborations to explore various aspects of infectious diseases, ranging from their molecular biology all the way to population-level health policies.

Recent studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota can induce changes in weight; however, no studies have investigated the gut microbiota as a determinant of chronic malnutrition or stunting. We performed secondary analyses of data from two well-characterized twin cohorts of children from Malawi and Bangladesh to identify bacterial genera associated with linear growth. In a case-control analysis, we used the graphical lasso to estimate covariance network models of gut microbial interactions from relative genus abundances and used network analysis methods to select genera associated with stunting severity. In longitudinal analyses, we determined associations between these selected microbes and linear growth using between-within twin regression models to adjust for confounding and introduce temporality. Reduced microbiota diversity and increased covariance network density were associated with stunting severity, while increased relative abundance of Acidaminococcus sp. was associated with future linear growth deficits.

Recent studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota can induce changes in weight; however, no studies have investigated the gut microbiota as a determinant of chronic malnutrition or stunting. We performed secondary analyses of data from two well-characterized twin cohorts of children from Malawi and Bangladesh to identify bacterial genera associated with linear growth. In a case-control analysis, we used the graphical lasso to estimate covariance network models of gut microbial interactions from relative genus abundances and used network analysis methods to select genera associated with stunting severity. In longitudinal analyses, we determined associations between these selected microbes and linear growth using between-within twin regression models to adjust for confounding and introduce temporality. Reduced microbiota diversity and increased covariance network density were associated with stunting severity, while increased relative abundance of Acidaminococcus sp. was associated with future linear growth deficits.

The current system for detecting pathogens is entirely reactive, reliant on aggregating local reports by clinicians, and typically takes weeks of symptomatic human infections before detection. Project Premonition aims to detect pathogens before they cause outbreaks, using mosquitoes to sample pathogens in the environment. Turning a mosquito into a device requires new technologies to autonomously locate, robotically collect, and computationally analyze mosquitoes. In this talk, I will provide an overview of Project Premonition, and present some recent results from field trials using our autonomous traps. Most of the talk, however, will focus on what we do after we collect the mosquitos, which is the effort I lead. Once we have mosquitos, we deep sequence them, then attempt to identify the identity of the host, as well as any viruses, bacteria, or parasites detectable in the bloodmeal. This is essentially a pan-metagenomics problem, in which source DNA may have derived from any vertebrate, plant, virus, bacterium or fungus, and for which the primary host genome (the mosquito\u2019s) is poorly characterized. We have therefore designed a high-throughput metagenomics pipeline that uses all of RefSeq (and many additional viral databases) as it\u2019s reference. To deal with the sparsity of RefSeq relative to global species diversity, we must identify distant matches, but we must simultaneously distinguish among highly homologous sequences. To this end, we use a mixture model approach to share information across reads. Currently, the end-to-end pipeline runs in <10hrs, and has been applied to genetic samples from mosquitos, ticks, birds and other challenging scenarios. I will discuss the algorithmic approach, early results on synthetic and real data, and key challenges and opportunities Bio: I am a senior researcher at Microsoft Researcher, where I\u2019ve been in various groups since 2008.

My research interests have also been focused on computational biology. Since my graduate days, I have largely focused on viruses and immunology, with a special focus on HIV. Specifically, most of my work begins with the observation that the high genetic variability of HIV provides the substrate for rapid adaptation, which in turn provides a window into the immune response. Following this paradigm, I have published over 70 papers in the field, covering topics such as HIV transmission, cellular and innate immune responses, and vaccine design.

Phylogenetic profiles have been used for nearly twenty years to cluster genes based on measures such as the Euclidean distance between profile vectors. However, most approaches do not take into account the phylogenetic relationships amongst the profiled genomes, and overrepresentation of certain taxonomic groups (for example, intensively sequenced pathogens) can skew the interpretation of profiles. We propose a new approach that uses a coevolutionary method defined by Pagel to account for the phylogenetic relationships amongst target organisms, and a hierarchical clustering approach to define sets of genes with common distributions. Our simple hierarchical approach outperforms more-sophisticated clustering algorithms, and the clusters we obtain show greater evidence of phylogenetic and functional clustering than another recently published approach. Clusters we identified through our approach include amino-acid biosynthesis genes that constitute cohesive pathways, and motility/chemotaxis genes with common histories of descent and lateral gene transfer.

Active enhancers are often characterized by the presence of short, unstable transcripts termed enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). While their function remains unclear, we demonstrate that eRNAs are a powerful readout of TF activity. We infer sites of eRNA origination across hundreds of publicly available nascent transcription datasets and show that eRNAs initiate from sites of TF binding. By quantifying the co-localization of TF-binding motifs and eRNA origins, we derive a simple statistic capable of inferring TF activity. In doing so, we uncover dozens of previously unexplored links between diverse stimuli and the TFs they affect. Our approach constitutes a fundamentally unique strategy for discovering links between TF activity and phenotypes.

Our recent focus has been on enhancers and their transcripts (eRNAs) which we detect and study by leveraging true measures of nascent transcription such as global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq).

Web-site: Melissa Wilson Sayres Twitter: @mwilsonsayres Abstract: The human X and Y chromosomes evolved from a pair of homologous autosomes, but today have vastly different gene content and structure. Curiously, despite tremendous sex-bias in human disease, the sex chromosomes are rarely included in genome-wide analyses of human health and disease. One of the reasons for this exclusion is that the X and Y chromosomes don\u2019t follow autosomal patterns of inheritance. However, even when they are included, technical biases resulting from aligning all sequences to a single reference genome can result in erroneous results. I will present results that failing to account for the ancestral sequence similarity between the human X and Y can affect variant calling and inference of gene expression.

Web-site: Max Libbrecht Twitter: @maxlibbrecht Abstract: Despite having sequenced the human genome over fifteen years ago, much is still unknown about how it functions. With the advent of high-throughput genomics technologies, it is now possible to measure properties of the genome across the entire genome in a single experiment, such as measuring where a given protein binds to the DNA or what genes are expressed. However, the complexity and massive scale of these data sets\u2013billions of base pairs with thousands of measurements each\u2013pose challenges to their analysis. My research focuses on the development of new machine learning methods that address the challenges posed by genomics data sets. I will focus on two projects. First, I will present on method for understanding chromatin domains. The genomic domain where a gene resides (on the scale of 100k-1M base pairs) influences its regulation: the same gene with the same local regulatory elements (that is, the same promoter) may be expressed in one neighborhood but be silent in another. This type of regulation is crucial for gene regulation, but is currently much less well understood than local regulation. I will present a new method for discovering and annotating genomic domains that integrates many types of genomics data sets. Unlike previous methods, this approach can incorporate information about the 3D conformation of the genome in the nucleus. This is possible through a novel type of regularization applied to a probabilistic graphical model. Second, I will present on the use of submodular optimization for selecting representative subsets of biological data sets. Convex optimization has revolutionized many fields in the past few decades, including machine learning and computational biology. Submodularity is a discrete analog to convexity: a set function\u2014that is a mathematical function defined on subsets of a larger set\u2014is submodular if it satisfies a particular diminishing returns property. Submodular optimization has had great success in many fields, but it is not yet widely used in biology. I demonstrate the utility of submodular optimization for biology with two applications: (1) selecting a most-informative panel of genomics assays to perform on a new tissue type, and (2) removing redundancy in protein sequence data sets.

These microbes are integral to the biology of the host, playing key roles in defense, development, and nutrient acquisition. Yet, we do not understand basic parameters of community assembly and dynamics on marine hosts. For example, is there a core microbiota for each species that performs essential functions? Are microbial taxa species-specific, or are they broadly shared across seaweed species? We surveyed the epibiotic communities of bacteria and protists living on 35 sympatric species of seagrass and seaweed in the nearshore environment along the central coast of British Columbia. By sampling multiple replicates for each species and the environmental pool of microbes from the water column and biofilms we are able determine which microbes are 1) characteristic of host species, 2) broadly distributed across seaweeds and seagrass, and 3) transients from the environment. We show that bacteria are much more likely to be specific to a host species, while protists are broadly distributed across seaweeds and seagrasses. These results suggest that community assembly and co-evolutionary history differ for protists and bacteria on marine hosts.

Research in the Parfrey lab focuses on the microbial ecology of eukaryotic microbes (protists) and their interaction with bacteria.

We don\u2019t usually have an event in January, but this year Jennifer Gardy worked with us to organize a special event with two featured speakers. Event Details **Date: Jan 11th Time: 6pm Location: BCCRC First Floor Lecture Theatre 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver BC ** Hope to see you there! Speaker details below: Speaker: Gytis Dudas Title: Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the West African Ebola virus epidemic Abstract: The 2013\u20132016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Thanks to new technologies complete Ebola virus genomes were sequenced from over 5% of the known cases by various teams operating in the region. The sheer amount of sequence data have enabled a large international team to reconstruct the entire epidemic from the virus\u2019 perspective, and to reveal the factors that helped sustain Ebola virus transmission across the region. Future infectious disease outbreaks are likely to generate similar kinds of data, and hopefully follow the blueprint set by our study. Bio: Gytis Dudas is a Lithuanian researcher based at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle currently working with Trevor Bedford. Gytis trained as an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, where he stayed to do a PhD on the evolution of diverse RNA viruses with Andrew Rambaut. Gytis\u2019 research focuses on understanding transmission patterns of rapidly evolving RNA pathogens, by studying viral populations through the lens of population genetics, and identifying evolutionary, ecological and physical barriers that these viruses experience. Speaker: James Hadfield Title: Communicating genomic epidemiology in real-time Abstract: The role of genomics in epidemiology is expanding, with recent retrospective analyses of the ebola and zika epidemics providing relevant insights for public health and epidemic control. Nextstrain and ARTIC are efforts to uncover and disseminate these results in real-time. This involves rapid field-deployable sequencing, the open sharing of genomic data, efficient bioinformatic pipelines and innovative ways to display the results. This talk will focus on the interactive visualization of genomic data for ongoing epidemics and the role this can play in communicating information to scientists & public health officials. Bio: James Hadfield completed a BSc (hons) in Mathematics in his home country of New Zealand and a PhD in computational biology from Cambridge University before moving to Trevor Bedford\u2019s lab at the Fred Hutch in Seattle.

Abstract : Many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to treatment, therefore early diagnosis and treatment is imperative. Despite recent advances, the genetic basis of many metabolic phenotypes remain unknown. For discovery purposes, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with clinical and bioinformatics expertise is currently the primary method used to identify novel disease-causing variants, however, causation is often difficult to establish due to the number of plausible variants. Integrated analysis of untargeted metabolomics (UM) and WES or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data is a promising systematic approach for identifying causal variants. In this pilot study, we present an automated bioinformatics approach for the integration of WES with UM data from seven neurometabolic patients with known IEMs and 15 controls; our goal was to identify concordance between genetic and metabolomic dysregulation and illustrate the challenges and successes of combining such large datasets. We found that the efficacy of this approach is intimately associated with the type of protein coded by the causative gene, and the uniqueness of its metabolic signature.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks occur rarely, at a rate of roughly one per year per hundred million doses delivered. The low cVDPV emergence rate contrasts with the high reversion rates of attenuating substitutions in OPV recipients. I will discuss how poliovirus genetic sequencing and epidemiological data work together to help us understand the separation of scales between cVDPV emergence and its underlying microevolution. The evidence highlights that virulence, within-host fitness, and between-host transmissibility are not equivalent.

These range from reconstructing who infected whom with the help of sequence data, to using machine learning tools to predict successful and unsuccessful pathogen sub-groups on trees, to building predictive models to design intervention strategies. She has constructed metrics on both labelled and unlabelled phylogenetic trees, which help to uncover distinct alternative stories of the ancestry patterns among a set of taxa, and to compare evolution in different places and times (or to compare simulations to data). She also works on modelling diverse circulating infections, and has found that interactions between pathogen strains are a key determinant of their responses to human interventions. She is a founding member of Imperial College London\u2019s Centre for the Mathematics of Precision Healthcare, and has recently moved to Simon Fraser University to take up a Canada 150 Research Chair in the Department of Mathematics. Abstract: As sequencing becomes more affordable, routine sequencing has the potential to influence the public health response to outbreaks. A key first step is typically to assign cases to clusters based on sequence similarity, for example grouping cases together if the sequences are within 12 SNPs of each other. Once clusters are identified, further investigation can be done to identify transmission events and reconstruct the outbreak to inform current or future control measures. In this talk I will discuss an alternative to SNP thresholds to define transmission clusters. Our approach is based on computing the probability that there were many intermediate transmissions separating two cases, and assigning cases to clusters according to not only the SNP distances between sequences but to the number of intermediate transmissions. Next, I will describe a Bayesian approach to reconstruct an outbreak based on sequence data, timing information and clinical data, and I will outline our machine learning approach to include demographic data, clinical data and behavioural data in our analysis alongside sequences and clusters.

She then joined PROOF Centre of Excellence where she led the statistical analysis of proteomics data. She is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia and a Canada Research Chair-II in Statistical Proteomics. Her research interests are in robust estimation and regularization of linear models with applications to Statistical Genomics and Proteomics. Abstract: Prediction of protein levels from mRNA levels has long been fraught with unreliability and lack of precision.

The resulting hierarchies of viral genetic diversity present challenges for clinical care and public health and unparalleled opportunities to study evolution. Evolutionary genetic thinking, methods, and tools when integrated with clinical characteristics and molecular sequence data derived from viral pathogens lead to strong inferences. In my laboratory we apply such integrative analyses to studies of a variety of viral pathogens including HIV and HCV at all levels of epidemic hierarchies: from population to patient. A key problem at the population level is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to both 1) identify new diagnoses and 2) identify remaining pockets of ongoing viral transmission, particularly in well-managed epidemics in the developed world. One approach to this is through phylogenetic monitoring \u2013 the process by which in near real time clusters of diagnoses are identified through harnessing of large, rapidly growing, sequence databases with bioinformatic and computational tools. A second key problem at the patient level is the analysis of next generation sequencing data derived from individual infections when the viral population is composed of a mixture of lineages derived from different sources. In this seminar I will first discuss methods and applications of phylogenetic monitoring of HIV at the population level within BC and Canada; second at the patient level I will discuss analyses of individual infections of HCV derived from multiple infections with different lineages.

To overcome excessive genomic background introduced by the host and reduce the sequencing depth required to recover viral genome sequences, hybridization probe enrichment is often used to increase the proportion of viral material in the sequencing library. In this method, synthetic DNA oligomers complementary to the viral genome are used to capture target material while background material is washed away. The design of these probe sequences presents a bioinformatic challenge for viral species with extensive genomic diversity and rapid mutation rates. This talk will discuss a pipeline for designing probe sequences against highly diverse viral pathogens. It will also demonstrate how these tools were used to recover avian influenza virus genomes in sediment from wild bird habitats in the Fraser Valley and Lower Mainland.

The Kundaje lab develops interpretable machine learning methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation from large-scale functional genomics data and decipher the genetic and genomic basis of disease. Anshul completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Columbia University in 2008. As a postdoc at Stanford (2008-12) and a Research Scientist at MIT (2012-13), he led the integrative analysis efforts of ENCODE Consortium and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Anshul is a recipient of the 2019 HUGO Chen Award of Excellence, the 2016 NIH Director\u2019s New Innovator Award and the 2014 Alfred Sloan Foundation Fellowship. Abstract: Functional genomics experiments profiling genome-wide regulatory state have revealed millions of putative regulatory elements in diverse cell states. These massive datasets have spurred the development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that can accurate map DNA sequence to associated cell-type specific molecular phenotypes such as TF binding, chromatin accessibility, splicing and gene expression. I will present a critical overview of a variety of deep learning architectures, training and model evaluation strategies for learning predictive regulatory models from functional genomics profiles. Beyond high prediction accuracy, the primary appeal of DNNs is that they are capable of automatically learning predictive, biologically relevant patterns directly from raw data representations (e.g. raw DNA sequence) without many prior assumptions. I will present efficient interpretation engines for deep learning models to decipher nucleotide-resolution transcription factor binding events, consolidated TF motif representations, cooperative and epistatic motif interactions in cis-regulatory sequence grammars, dynamic cis and trans regulatory drivers of cellular differentiation and non-coding regulatory genetic variants.

However, the design of GWAS prevent us from directly estimating the causal effects of each locus, eliminating a straightforward way to learn a mutation\u2019s mechanism of action. In previous studies, this has been overcome through the use of methods based on Mendelian randomization, which allows us to use genotype, and GWAS summary statistics, to infer the causal effect of a separate risk variable on disease. With multi-omic datasets, one can begin to reason about the causal role mutations play in regulating molecular traits, such as gene expression, without needing to draw power from studies of large cohorts. In recent work from our group, we used an established causal inference test (CIT) to infer instances whereby genetic associations with gene expression were mediated by molecular traits. However, with potentially hundreds of loci associated with a single gene, the use of one test per locus likely fails to account for the role of complex interaction between loci. In order to investigate the benefit of considering multiple loci in multi-omic causal inference, I apply methods for reducing genotype to a smaller set of latent variables, which I use in place of genotype in our previous mediation tests. I apply this method to multi-omic dataset comprised of 411 tissue samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of older individuals all having H3K27 acetylation, Illumina 450k array methylation data, as well as imputed genotypes derived from the Affymetrix GeneChip 6.0 platform. Using several latent variable methods, I explore whether or not accounting for several genotypes simultaneously can improve our ability to detect causal mediation in a multi-omic data set.\u201d Webcast Link: https://vidyoreplay.computecanada.ca/replay/webcastShow.html?key=OS63GYOfyFK3aRo (This technology is brought to you by Compute Canada and WestGrid with support from PHSA Telehealth)","title":"Apr - Anshul Kundaje"},{"location":"archive/2019/2019-04-11/#apr-anshul-kundaje","text":"Speaker : Anshul Kundaje Talk Title: \u201cDeciphering cis-regulatory logic using interpretable deep learning models\u201d Event Details Date/Time: Thursday, April 11, 2019 6:00pm Affiliation: Assistant Professor of Genetics and Computer Science, Stanford University Website: Anshul Kundaje Bio: Anshul Kundaje is an Assistant Professor of Genetics and Computer Science at Stanford University.

His research focuses on understanding protein structure and function, and its potential applications in food, biomaterials and medicine. Dee\u2019s research is an unusual combination of food science and biophysics. His research involves a variety of biochemical, molecular biology and biophysical approaches and offers a training environment that blends basic and applied sciences to better understand and utilize food proteins and enzymes. His potential collaborators are food scientists, physicists, and computer simulation specialists. One of his current projects is the genetic modification and engineering of protein nanofibrils. Protein nanofibrils are threads of protein only a few molecules wide yet a thousand times longer. They have unique properties which motivate research into how to mimic nature and create new functional materials. Abstract: Proteins can adopt various conformations, including native, unfolded, misfolded, and aggregated states. The aggregates can be amorphous or well-ordered, such as amyloid fibrils. In certain cases, fibril formation is associated with disease (e.g., prion diseases, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and ALS). In a growing number of cases, proteins form amyloid fibrils as part of their natural role, serving as functional amyloid. Potentially any protein can be induced to form amyloid-like fibrils, also called nanofibrils. Nanofibrils hold promise for applications ranging from biosensors, nanowires, cell scaffolding, and, perhaps, as food ingredients. The mechanisms of protein aggregation must be better understood in order to prevent amyloid formation, in the case of disease-associated amyloid, or such that it can be controlled, in the case of engineering functional nanofibrils.

Dr. Aparicio\u2019s research program encompasses the fields of cancer genomics, cancer evolution, single cell biology, mouse genetic models, high throughput screens, small molecule chemical probe development and translational breast cancer research. His work on the molecular taxonomy of breast cancer led to identification of new genes that could change the way breast cancer is diagnosed, and form the basis of next-generation treatments. This discovery was preceded by another breakthrough in decoding the genetic makeup of the most-deadly form of breast cancer, known as triple negative subtype (TNBC). Dr. Aparicio is also working to develop quantitative measures of clonal fitness in patients, including methods for single cell genome sequencing and PDX models of human cancer. He collaborates widely with other groups, with current projects including the genomic and biochemical analysis of lymphoma, ovarian cancer, and several rare pediatric cancers. He was a co-founder of Paradigm Therapeutics (now, Takeda Cambridge) and currently Contextual Genomics Ltd. Abstract: A fundamental biological property of cancers is that they evolve over time and this feature underpins drug resistance and metastasis. We are using a combination of leading edge measurement methods including single cell genomics in concert with statistical models and computational methods to address the fundamental questions of how to identify relevant cell populations, identifying the molecular encoding of fitness phenotypes and predicting future behavior. In my seminar I will give a brief introduction and background to the measurements, mathematical approaches and model systems and describe some recent results from studying breast and ovarian cancers.

He is currently the Co-director of the Graduate Stream in Computational Biology, Department of Molecular Genetics. Dr. Morris pursued graduate training and research in machine learning at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, England and obtained his PhD in Computational Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His areas of research include Computational Biology, Machine Learning, Cancer Genomics, RNA-binding proteins, Functional Genomics, Post-transcriptional regulation, Electronic Health Records and Health Informatics. His lab studies the evolutionary history of tumors, using machine learning and statistical modeling to understand how different populations of cells evolve over time. Abstract: There are 10 trillion mutated copies of your genome in your body; a thousand times more copies than humans who have ever lived. Each of these somatic genomes, if you are as old as I am, carries between 50 and 50,000 somatic DNA mutations. In contrast, each new human is born with only about 50 germline mutations. So, there are between a thousand and a million times more somatic mutations events occurring in your body, in your lifetime, than have ever occurred in the human germline. And unlike humans, who have an exponentially expanding population; you have a fixed number of cells that are in constant competition for resources. Cancer is a tragic, but common, result of this massive-scale experiment in human genome evolution. A handful of the 1000s of somatic mutations in cancerous and pre-cancerous cells are \u201cdriver\u201d mutations that bestow fitness advantages that cause selective sweeps that drastically increase the frequency of mutated cells. These sweeps also increase the frequency of \u201cpassenger\u201d mutations accumulated since the last such sweep. These latter mutations have little impact on cell function but provide information about the mutational processes that generated them. Both their type (i.e., A to C) and genomic locations depend not only what caused the mutation \u2014 e.g., UV light \u2013 but also the chromatin state of the cell that acquired them. I will describe our work developing methods to classify somatic mutations into different \u2018subclones\u2019 that correspond to different sweeps. Our methods also use phylogenetic approaches to determine the relative order in which the sweeps occurred. We have also developed methods to interpret this historical record of the cancer. Specifically, we are attempting to use the timing and time-dependent patterns of somatic mutations to reconstruct the historical changes that a normal precursor cell underwent during its transformation into a cancerous cell. We also study pre-cancerous patterns of somatic evolution that can be read out of deeply sequenced blood populations. I will also briefly describe our preliminary work in using deep neural networks to use these data to infer properties of an individual\u2019s hematopoietic stem cells which cause age-related clonal hematopoiesis.

Prior to his appointment as assistant professor, Dr. Pennell was an Izaak Killam Memorial and NSERC postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Zoology at UBC. He also worked as a Graduate Fellow at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham, NC. He received his PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Idaho and his bachelor\u2019s degree from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC. He received a Young Investigator Award from the American Society of Naturalists in 2016 and the Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution in 2019. He is fascinated by life\u2019s variety and seek general explanations for how it arose and how it is maintained. A basic premise of his research is that these two aims are interdependent: what we see today is the result of ecological and evolutionary processes operating in concert across \u2018deep time\u2019. In his research, he builds theory, statistical methods, and computational tools to investigate how the interactions of these processes have played out over history. He has a particular fondness for phylogenetic trees, the historical pattern of branching that connects organisms to one another, and work to understand what these can tell us about the long-term dynamics of evolutionary change. To complement this work, he also develop general informatics tools for handling, manipulating, and sharing biodiversity data. Abstract: A central challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand why some lineages contain so much diversity while others have so few; ultimately this means estimating and explaining variation in rates of diversification \u2014 the rate at which lineages split and go extinct. This is not only a major problem in macroevolutionary research (where my background is) but is also important for characterizing the dynamics of viral epidemics and cell division within development, including antibody diversification and cancer proliferation. In this talk, I will discuss recent progress in applying statistical models to estimate diversification dynamics from phylogenetic trees constructed from genomic data. While there has been tremendous excitement about this line of research, there has also been persistent questions about the reliability of evolutionary inferences made from molecular phylogenies alone. I will address these questions by presenting some brand new work from my research group in which we clarify precisely what information about evolutionary dynamics can be obtained by comparing genomic sequences. I will end by discussing how these new results might be applied to help us better understand epidemics and cellular proliferation.

He works in 3 major areas. First, data structures for indexing and searching DNA archives (Bradley et al, Nature Biotechnology 2019 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09624), allowing for example MLST-typing of all E coli genomes in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), predicting drug resistance in all M. tuberculosis, or tracking plasmids across species. Second, variant calling software tailored for bacterial pan-genomes, working with both nanopore and illumina data, and avoid using reference genomes entirely. Third, translation of the above (and other) methods for analysis of M. tuberculosis in public health settings; in particular the Mykrobe tool for drug resistance prediction (Bradley et al, Nature Communications, 2015), analysis of sequence data after direct extraction from sputum (Votintseva et al, J Clin Microbiol 2017), and leading the sequence analysis of 100,000 M.tuberculosis genomes for the CRyPTIC project. Abstract: When we study evolution of a species, we use different models, depending on what we want to achieve or infer. We might restrict to SNP variation in the \u201ccore genome\u201d (presumably inherited vertically) to study phylogeography or to study an outbreak. In reducing the problem to the analysis of SNPs (and invariant sites), it has been possible for researchers to build a range of sophisticated phylogenetic models. However once we try to incorporate genome organisation, chromosomal rearrangements, movement of plasmids, transposons or phage, then the modelling problem is far harder. The question of how to properly model bacterial genetic variation is wide open and extremely challenging. A prerequisite for any solution to this, is a decision on how to describe the variation in the first place \u2013 you cannot model variation until you represent it. Note that this is true even if you have perfect genome assemblies: even if it were possible to multiple sequence align them, this would not really help with how to notice that a SNP at one position in one genome is \u201cthe same\u201d as a SNP somewhere else in another. In this talk, I want to discuss a solution we have been developing to this representation problem. We show how it is possible to represent the pan genome of a species as a network of \u201cfloating\u201d graphs, representing the ensemble of known variation in pathology blocks (we use genes and intergenic regions, but this could be done for mobile elements also). In doing so it becomes possible to discover and describe genetic variation at fine (SNP/indel) and coarse (gene order) level. This is a major research theme for my group and I describe progress to date, including results on both illumina and nanopore.

We have assessed the resilience of the gut ecosystem to osmotic perturbation at multiple length and time scales. By sequencing, we have shown that osmotic stress causes consistent, lasting changes to human and mouse microbiotas in a mouse model, leading to the extinction of highly abundant taxa and expansion of less prevalent members. Importantly, quantitative imaging has enabled us to identify how changes in the gut environment lead to disruption of the native microbiota membership and function. We show that the mucosal interface separating bacteria from the epithelium is decimated during osmotic perturbation, leading to decreases in mucin consuming bacteria and mucin glycoside hydrolase expression by commensals.

He implemented the genome annotation method Segway, which simplifies interpretation of large multivariate genomic datasets, and was a linchpin of the NIH ENCODE Project analysis. He is a principal investigator at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Associate Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, University of Toronto. He was named a CIHR New Investigator and has received several awards for his academic work, including the NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, and the Ontario Early Researcher Award. Abstract: First, we will discuss a new method, Virtual ChIP-seq which predicts binding of individual transcription factors in new cell types using an artificial neural network that integrates ChIP-seq results from other cell types and chromatin accessibility data in the new cell type. Virtual ChIP-seq also uses learned associations between gene expression and transcription factor binding at specific genomic regions. This approach outperforms methods that use transcription factor sequence preferences in the form of position weight matrices, predicting binding for 33 transcription factors. Second, we will discuss a new method to discover transcription factor motifs and identify transcription factor binding sites in DNA with covalent modifications such as methylation. Just as transcription factors distinguish one standard nucleobase from another, they also distinguish unmodified and modified bases. To represent the modified bases in a sequence, we replace cytosine (C) with symbols for 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Similarly, we adapted the well-established position weight matrix model of transcription factor binding affinity to an expanded alphabet. We created an expanded-alphabet genome sequence using genome-wide maps of 5mC, and 5hmC in mouse naive T cells. Using this sequence and expanded-alphabet position weight matrixes, we reproduced various known methylation binding preferences, including the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP\u03b2 for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated motifs.

Affiliation: Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia Bio: Dr. Huan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of British Columbia. He received his Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry from the University of Alberta under the supervision of Dr. Liang Li on developing chemical isotope labelling -based metabolomics. After graduation, Dr. Huan did postdoctoral work with Dr. Gary Siuzdak at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA) to bring metabolomics into systems biology for an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms. In July 2018, Dr. Huan was hired as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of British Columbia. At UBC, Dr. Huan\u2019s research focuses on the synergistic development of analytical and bioinformatic methods for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Dr. Huan has published 56 peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, including Nature Methods, Nature Protocols, and Analytical Chemistry with over 1900 citations and an h-index of 22. Dr. Huan is currently a steering committee and faculty member of UBC Social Exposome Cluster. In addition, Dr. Huan is affiliated faculty members in the Graduate Program in Bioinformatics, Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program, and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. Abstract: Metabolomics is an emerging field of research in the post genomic era of biology. Among the various analytical tools used in metabolomics, mass spectrometry (MS) is the key technique owing to its high sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. This presentation will focus on the latest bioinformatic developments in the Huan lab to address big data challenges in MS-based metabolomics. In particular, I will introduce a recently discovered phenomena of ratio bias and fold-change compression in the linear electrospray ionization (ESI) regions.

Affiliation: Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia Bio: Dr. Huan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of British Columbia. He received his Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry from the University of Alberta under the supervision of Dr. Liang Li on developing chemical isotope labelling -based metabolomics. After graduation, Dr. Huan did postdoctoral work with Dr. Gary Siuzdak at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA) to bring metabolomics into systems biology for an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms. In July 2018, Dr. Huan was hired as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of British Columbia. At UBC, Dr. Huan\u2019s research focuses on the synergistic development of analytical and bioinformatic methods for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Dr. Huan has published 56 peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, including Nature Methods, Nature Protocols, and Analytical Chemistry with over 1900 citations and an h-index of 22. Dr. Huan is currently a steering committee and faculty member of UBC Social Exposome Cluster. In addition, Dr. Huan is affiliated faculty members in the Graduate Program in Bioinformatics, Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) program, and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. Abstract: Metabolomics is an emerging field of research in the post genomic era of biology. Among the various analytical tools used in metabolomics, mass spectrometry (MS) is the key technique owing to its high sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. This presentation will focus on the latest bioinformatic developments in the Huan lab to address big data challenges in MS-based metabolomics. In particular, I will introduce a recently discovered phenomena of ratio bias and fold-change compression in the linear electrospray ionization (ESI) regions. In addition, I will talk about recently developed deep learning algorithms, which recognize high quality metabolic features and extract bioactive steroids from untargeted metabolomics data. Finally, I will present a novel core-structure-based spectral similarity algorithm, which has been demonstrated to better reveal chemical structural similarities using their spectral similarities.

Previously, she held a Schmidt Science Fellowship and Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge. She completed her postdoctoral training with Dr. John Marioni at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and European Bioinformatics Institute. Prior to this, she obtained her PhD at UBC under the supervision of Dr. Sohrab Shah and Dr. Sam Aparicio. Her research focused on breast cancer susceptibility and tumour evolution, and she co-led the development of new methods for profiling single cell genomes at scale. Abstract: Tumours are heterogeneous populations of cells whose evolution in response to selective pressures underpins treatment resistance and metastatic progression. This talk will focus on recent developments in experimental and analytical methods for single cell genomics. We will discuss direct library preparation (DLP), a high throughput tagmentation-based approach for generating single cell whole genome sequencing libraries without pre-amplification. By using fragment coordinates as unique molecular identifiers, DLP offers improved coverage uniformity. This enables high-resolution copy number inference at the single cell level and single nucleotide variant calling at the clone or population level. Finally, we will present a new probabilistic model that enables true absolute aneuploidy inference from single cell genomes, addressing a long-standing challenge in cancer informatics and revealing previously undetected sub-populations in complex breast and ovarian tumours.

Since starting his own lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 2012, his research has aimed to understand the flow of information from the genome to whole organism biology through modeling and analysis of functional genomics data. This research is broadly integrative across modalities, systems, and even species, but also integrative across levels of organization, using molecular processes within cells to understand how and why cells diversify and how that diversity, in turn, affects organism phenotype. Dr. Gillis\u2019 graduate training was in Computational Neuroscience. He obtained a PhD with Frances Skinner from the University of Toronto. His post-doc, with Paul Pavlidis, at the University of Toronto focused on largescale integration of expression data to improve our understanding of gene function. Abstract: X-chromosome inactivation is an epigenetic process that regulates gene dosage in females. Occurring as a random coin-flip early in development, the status of inactivation is then stably inherited down cell lineages via DNA methylation. The degree of \u201cskewing\u201d toward one chromosome over the other has been researched intensively, and importantly it has been linked to disease, where female carriers of X-linked disorders can have differential disease penetrance as a function of skewing. But what about the autosomes? Is the allelic expression of autosomal genes epigenetically regulated? And if so, could it have an impact on disease risk? In this work, we uncover one major axis of random variation with a large and permanent regulatory influence on the allelic expression on autosomes: developmental stochasticity. By assaying the transcriptome of wild monozygotic quadruplets of the nine-banded armadillo, we find that persistent changes occur early in development, and these give rise to clear transcriptional signatures which uniquely characterize individuals relative to siblings.

Abstract: Endometrial cancer (EC) has increased by 2-3% per year since 2005, due in part to a global increase in obesity, a common risk factor. In this talk, I will motivate the need for early screening and prevention in EC using self-testing and minimally invasive approaches. I will describe the protocol of an upcoming feasibility study where we identify and recruit asymptomatic, menopausal women at high-risk for EC using a two-step screening approach. Participants will be directed to a tailored hormonal and lifestyle intervention.

Affiliation: Assistant Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology/OVCARE, UBC Bio: Dr. Talhouk is an assistant professor in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia. She is also the director of data science and informatics at OVCARE, BC\u2019s ovarian and gynecological cancer research program. She completed her PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia in 2013 with a focus on computational statistics and machine learning. Since then, she has been working on developing and implementing predictive models to improve patient care in women\u2019s health and oncology. Her research focus also includes the ethics of data sharing and privacy in the era of digital health and AI modeling. Abstract: Endometrial cancer (EC) has increased by 2-3% per year since 2005, due in part to a global increase in obesity, a common risk factor. In this talk, I will motivate the need for early screening and prevention in EC using self-testing and minimally invasive approaches. I will describe the protocol of an upcoming feasibility study where we identify and recruit asymptomatic, menopausal women at high-risk for EC using a two-step screening approach. Participants will be directed to a tailored hormonal and lifestyle intervention. As part of this study, we will also evaluate whether DNA mutations and microbiome data can predict endometrial pathology.

He did his PhD in the lab of Tim Hughes at the University of Toronto, and was a postdoctoral fellow in Aviv Regev\u2019s lab at the Broad institute until the end of 2019, after which he moved to his current position at UBC. Abstract: In this talk, I will present two recent works from our lab based on high throughput gene expression measurements of random DNA. We measured the gene regulatory activities of over 100 million random promoter sequences in the model eukaryote yeast S. cerevisiae. We then used these data to train interpretable and deep learning models that relate DNA sequence to gene expression. The interpretable model captures the biochemical activities of the proteins (transcription factors) that regulate gene expression, and their interactions with chromatin from scratch, and revealed an unexpected prevalence of weak gene regulatory interactions. The deep learning (transformer) model enabled us to query the evolution of gene expression, and revealed an unexpectedly dynamic evolutionary space for promoter sequences while providing insight into the evolutionary past and future of promoter sequences. The \u201cBig Data\u201d we generated in these studies has proven to be exceptionally rich, and we hope it will serve as a standard dataset for machine learning for gene regulation.

A genetic epidemiologist by training, Jessica applies methods to emerging big data resources in population health. She aims to understand how genetic, epigenetic, and environmental differences between people contribute to variation in disease susceptibility, to treatment, and recovery. A primary goal of her research is to reduce the suffering associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, which together account for more years lost to disability and death than either cancer or cardiovascular disease. She conducts studies in large population datasets, with a major interest in electronic health records and biobanks, and she works at the intersection of genetics, epidemiology, statistics, bioinformatics, and computer science. Jessica completed postdoctoral training in the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. She holds a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Toronto, where she was a fellow in the interdisciplinary CIHR-STAGE program (Canadian Institutes of Health Research Strategic Training for Advanced Genetic Epidemiology). She also holds a MSc in Epidemiology from the University of Ottawa and a BSc in Biology (minor in Genetics) from the University of Guelph. Abstract: The last decade has seen an explosion of genomic and health-related data. This explosion has in large part been fueled by the growth of large-scale biobanks, which are repositories of phenotype data linked to biospecimens (e.g., blood). Biobanks are designed to capture a range of data modalities, and are not designed with a single research question in mind. This core feature of biobank design enables a data-driven approach to quantifying, characterizing, and understanding the relationships between biospecimens and the phoneme. In this talk, I will highlight several large biobanking efforts worldwide, and the biological insights they are revealing. I will discuss results from a genome wide association study (GWAS) of loneliness using data from 23andMe and the UK Biobank, and follow-up analysis using polygenic scores and a phenome-wide association study in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center biobank. Finally, I will talk about recent work from my lab that integrates GWAS data with different omic data types to understand the prenatal origins of complex conditions such as asthma and ADHD. By the end of the talk, attendees should be able to: (i) discuss the typical objectives and study designs used in genetic epidemiology studies, and (ii) recognize different post-GWAS analysis options.

Emma completed her PhD in Biochemistry at McMaster University (Ontario) studying bacterial phylogeny and evolutionary molecular markers. She also has postdoctoral experience in fungal and chemical genetics, as well as developing ontologies for infectious disease outbreak investigation and surveillance. Her work focuses on the development of data standards and ontologies to support public health and food safety pathogen genomics data curation, sharing and analyses. Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health pathogen genomics played a critical role in tracking transmission, monitoring outbreaks both locally and globally, identifying variants of concern, providing data for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines, and in understanding viral evolution and origins. In order to make use of pathogen sequence data, it must be interpreted using contextual data (metadata). Contextual data includes sample metadata, laboratory methods, patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and epidemiological information. However, the variability in how contextual information is captured and encoded by different organizations and databases poses challenges for data interpretation, integration, and its use/re-use. The Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health (CIDGOH) at Simon Fraser University developed a data specification as well as a curation/validation/data transformation tool called the DataHarmonizer which were used by members of the Canadian COVID Genomics Network (CanCOGeN) to harmonize SARS-CoV-2 contextual data for national surveillance and for public repository submission. In order to support coordination of international surveillance efforts, we have partnered with the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology to make these resources available for use worldwide. The specification was also adapted for harmonizing Monkeypox data, and in conjunction with other harmonization projects for foodborne pathogens and wastewater, forms a framework for harmonizing public health contextual data.

This view, however, has changed as numerous functional roles of RNA molecules have now been discovered. Determining RNA function is complex and, in some cases, still infeasible experimentally. As RNA\u2019s function is mainly determined by its shape, computational methods determining RNA structure provide unique opportunities to help in determining RNA function. During my academic career I have extensively studied RNA structure in order to aid with function determination. In this talk, I showcase some of the algorithms we developed via their application in determining some functional sites of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. I further discuss their potential in discovering novel treatments and vaccines for current and future contagions, highlighting some challenges and future opportunities.

This view, however, has changed as numerous functional roles of RNA molecules have now been discovered. Determining RNA function is complex and, in some cases, still infeasible experimentally.

Despite being readily accessible with general-purpose libraries, so-called deep methods demand long hours of training, specialized hardware resources, and a large amount of data; yet, we are often startled at seeing only marginally improved classification performance, model overfitting, or lack of generalizability. Not undermining important advancements made possible by deep models, this talk will seek to showcase that we can deepen our understanding of biological systems with shallow statistical models. First, I will discuss our scalable algorithm for probabilistic topic modelling in single-cell genomics data. Based on probabilistic topic assignments in each cell, we identify the latent representation of cellular states and heterogeneity, and the latent topic vectors often yield much-improved clustering results than other types of dimensionality reduction methods. We were initially inspired by several empirical observations: (1) Data sets compressed by repeatedly applying random projection operations highlight cell type-specific signature genes. (2) We also noted that rare cell types are better characterized with lowly-expressed genes (in total data) that are typically removed in quality control steps, thus, not included in embedding model estimations. (3) Bulk sequencing data sets are generally less prone to zero inflation or measurement errors. Based on these key findings, we designed a statistical framework termed ASAP--short for Annotating Single-cell data matrix by Approximate Pseudo-bulk projection) to identify cell topics. ASAP seeks to reduce sample size by interactively collapsing cell-level expression vectors into pseudo-bulk vectors in order to accurately perform non-negative matrix factorization to learn topic-specific gene frequency patterns. Another example will be a sparse regression model with a causal inference flavour that can effectively handle putative confounding issues in a genetic fine-mapping problem. Our idea is rooted in Rubin's causal inference framework (Rubin and Rosenbaum, 1983), with which non-genetic and indirect genetic effects can be cancelled out in implicit adjustment steps. In order to handle the non-binary nature of exposure variables (genetic dosage), our method first matches individuals with one another based on a covariate similarity matrix. If paired individuals share non-genetic factors, then any gene expression changes between them will be removed so that genetic dosage will become a causal factor in the expression divergence. We implemented the algorithm in the SuSiE framework (Wang et al. 2020). Overall, this talk will reassure that it is okay to work on a shallow model. In fact, if our scientific goal is straightforward enough to be coded in a simple model armed with intuitive algorithms, such modelling approach can help uncover deeper layers of biological mechanisms underneath high-dimensional genomics data.

In this context, I will present our effort to analyze produce various end-to-end pipelines, databases and softwares that combine bioinformatics with mathematical and machine learning methods. One prime application will be to investigate the structural and functional heterogeneity of the ribosome from structural data. For that purpose, my group recently developed a database that provides a standardized nomenclature for comparing ribosomal components (proteins, RNA, ligands) across all the available structures from the PDB, with several specialized visualization tools. I will present our recent effort to further develop this tool and discuss applications in the context of the ribosome exit tunnel, a key compartment contains the nascent polypeptide chain. In a second part, I will describe how this work inspired us to develop more general methods, that use recent advances in computational geometry and machine learning for cryo-EM and biological shape analysis, from molecules to cells. These methods will include various applications of optimal transport-based distances for comparing 3D voxelized maps that outperform standard linear methods in Cryo-EM, and Riemannian elastic metrics that also yield better clustering and separation in comparison with the linear metric on various datasets of 2D cancer cell images.

She directs the CSIC network for Computational Biology and is co-founder of Biobam Bioinformatics, a start-up that provides bioinformatics tools for biologists. Ana Conesa\u2019s lab is interested in understanding functional aspects of gene expression at the genome-wide level and across different organisms. Her group has developed statistical methods and software tools for transcriptomics analysis and she has pioneered the development of methods for multi-omics integration and long-reads transcriptomics. A strong drive in her research is helping the genomics community to bridge the gap between data and knowledge by creating bioinformatics tools that everybody can use. Some of our popular software tools are Blast2GO, PaintOmics, maSigPro, NOISeq, Qualimap, SQANTI, tappAS, etc that have received over 37,000 citations. She has led multiple EU projects to develop methods for the analysis of the transcriptome, more recently with a focus on the utilization of long read sequencing to characterize transcriptome complexity. Abstract: Third-generation long-read sequencing technologies offer the potential to sequence entire transcripts and unravel the intricacies of transcriptomes. However, the analysis of long-read transcriptomics (lrRNA-seq) data presents numerous challenges. These challenges encompass distinguishing biological variability from technical noise, accurately predicting transcript models, providing precise estimates of transcript expression levels and differential expression, and elucidating the biological significance of isoform diversity. In my presentation, I will showcase the research conducted in my laboratory that addresses these challenges. Moreover, I will discuss how, through the implementation of appropriate experimental techniques and bioinformatics approaches, lrRNA-seq has the capability to unveil fresh insights into the biology of the transcriptome.

He received his PhD in Pathobiology and Translational Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in 2019. He then completed his postdoctoral training at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He joined SFU and HLI in 2021. The overarching goal of the Koelwyn lab is to apply a translational, \u2018omics-based approach for understanding how heart, lung and/or oncologic diseases communicate with each other through immune-specific mechanisms, leading to adverse systemic, tissue, and cellular responses. It also seeks to demonstrate how exercise \u2013 a low-cost public health strategy \u2013 can therapeutically improve immune function to protect from these diseases and their deleterious interactions. Abstract: A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Canada, with over 60,000 Canadians entering emergency rooms annually. The recovery from a heart attack requires a swift and coordinated response from our innate immune system, which responds to inflammatory signals generated by the infarct. Historically, it was believed this immune response, coordinated by monocytes and macrophages to clear debris and heal damaged tissue, had no lasting effect on the immune system. However, recent evidence from our group and others have shown this is not the case. In this talk, I\u2019ll discuss the recently developed concept of inflammatory memory, wherein monocytes and macrophages acquire \u2018learned\u2019 behavior following inflammatory events such as a heart attack, via epigenetic modifications, which result in long-term altered responses to subsequent immune challenges. I\u2019ll also discuss the \u2018omics tools used to identify heart attack-induced inflammatory memory, and the effect of such memory on future disease risk.

The recovery from a heart attack requires a swift and coordinated response from our innate immune system, which responds to inflammatory signals generated by the infarct. Historically, it was believed this immune response, coordinated by monocytes and macrophages to clear debris and heal damaged tissue, had no lasting effect on the immune system. However, recent evidence from our group and others have shown this is not the case. In this talk, I\u2019ll discuss the recently developed concept of inflammatory memory, wherein monocytes and macrophages acquire \u2018learned\u2019 behavior following inflammatory events such as a heart attack, via epigenetic modifications, which result in long-term altered responses to subsequent immune challenges. I\u2019ll also discuss the \u2018omics tools used to identify heart attack-induced inflammatory memory, and the effect of such memory on future disease risk.
