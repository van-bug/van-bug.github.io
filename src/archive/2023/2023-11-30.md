**Talk Title:** Learning computation from microbial evolution

![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/9rp74ktWyrI)

**Abstract:**

In the last decade, many advances in genomic algorithms have stemmed from the observation that genomes are not random strings but rather the product of a sparse evolutionary process. In this talk I will discuss how to use observations from evolution to inform algorithms for the prediction of antibiotic resistance, and more generally for the compression and efficient general computation on enormous genomic data sets.
