**Talk Title:** Methylation matters: tool development for community discovery

**Abstract:**

Innovative technologies now allow us to probe the epigenome in more dimensions and at higher resolution than ever before. However, meaningful biological insights are challenging to uncover in these high-dimensional settings where classical statistics fail, and relevant signals can be masked by technical artifacts and systematic biases unique to each specialized assay. To unlock the full potential of DNA methylation data, the development of novel statistical frameworks and tailored computational implementations is needed. In this talk I will outline the major hurdles and opportunities in analyzing genome-scale DNA methylation data, and highlight examples from recent and ongoing work. I'll also discuss the process of computational tool development and maintenance for the benefit of the bioinformatics user community.

**Bio:**

Keegan Korthauer is an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia and an investigator at the British Columbia Children’s Hospital Research Institute. Previously, she was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. She earned her PhD in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin Madison. Her research lies at the intersection of statistics and biology, and her group focuses on developing novel frameworks and rigorous inferential procedures that exploit the increased scope and scale of high-throughput sequencing data, with the ultimate goal of uncovering new molecular signals in cancer, child health, and development.
