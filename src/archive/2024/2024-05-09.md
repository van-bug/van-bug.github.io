**Bio:**

SABRINA LESLIE, PhD. studied honours physics and mathematics at the University of British
Columbia twenty years ago before moving to UC Berkeley where she obtained her PhD in optical
physics in 2008, followed by her Mary Fieser post-doctoral fellowship in biophysics at Harvard
University 2009-2011. There she invented the tether-free, high-throughput single-molecule
imaging technology called Convex Lens-induced Confinement (CLiC), which established her as a
pioneer in single-molecule investigations. In 2012, she became an Assistant Professor at McGill
University and founded her research group in the Physics Department. There she developed CLiC
into a platform technology and used it for new single-molecule studies of nucleic acids, proteins,
nanoparticles, polymers, biologics and cells. In 2019 she was honoured with the Young Investigator
Award from the Biophysical Society of Canada, and in 2020 she was elected to the Royal Society of
Canada (RSC) College of New Artists Scholars and Scientists, an honour which includes her efforts
to translate the value of her unique technology platform to society through the spin-out company
from her lab called ScopeSys. In 2021, she and her team re-located to the Michael Smith Labs at
UBC where her Associate Professor appointment is joint with the Department of Physics and
Astronomy and affiliated with the School of Biomedical Engineering, Genome Science and Applied
Technology and Bioinformatics programs. Dr. Leslie currently holds a Killam Accelerator Research
Fellowship (2022-2024), to help accelerate her work and support the translation of her singlemolecule and single-cell microscopy and biophysics research to society.

**Abstract:**

Everything you experience, from the smoothness of your sunscreen to the effectiveness of your vaccine, ultimately comes from the interactions of single molecules. In this talk, we share our "tether-free" single-molecule platform for directly imaging the motion and interactions of single molecules as well as single cells in physiological conditions. We share how this approach can be used to investigate, quantitate and understand the detailed properties of, for instance, lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA cargo and thereby help standardize and improve new classes of nanomedicines. "Seeing is Believing": the inspiration of our imaging work is to apply new quantitative analyses to investigate and unlock the intricate dynamics of nanomedicines in the complex conditions inside living cells, with back-to-back experiments in precisely controlled femto volumes in our microfluidic imaging devices.
