Come Join us for a special event to kick off the 2024 academic year with VanBUG. VanBUG is hosting a Bioinformatics Career Night on Friday, October 18, 2024, from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM. This event will feature three career speakers from different stages of their careers, offering valuable insights into various career paths in bioinformatics. Additionally, we are honored to have Dr. Kayla King (Professor and Canada Excellence Research Chair in the Departments of Zoology and Microbiology &amp; Immunology at the University of British Columbia, as well as Professorial Fellow in Biology, University of Oxford) as our keynote speaker.

This seminar will be live-streamed via Zoom.

There will be a social over complimentary food and refreshments after the talks.

### Keynote Speaker: Dr. Kayla King

Kayla King is a Professor and Canada Excellence Research Chair in the Departments of Zoology and Microbiology &amp; Immunology at the University of British Columbia, as well as Professorial Fellow in Biology, University of Oxford. Her research focuses on the evolution, ecology, and genomics of host-microbial pathogen interactions using a combination of experimental evolution, computational approaches, and collections from the wild. Dr. King received a BSc (2004) from UBC, followed by a MSc (2006) at Concordia University in Montreal, a PhD (2011) at Indiana University, followed by a prestigious Royal Society Newton Post-doctoral Fellowship at the University of Liverpool. She started as an Associate Professor (2013) before being promoted to Full Professor (2019) at Oxford. Dr. King was hired at UBC in 2023. Her honours include the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution Mid-Career Excellence Award (2023), Canadian Society of Zoologists R.A. Wardle Medal (2023), the Zoological Society of London Scientific Medal (2022), the Linnean Society Bicentenary Medal (2020), and the American Society of Naturalists Early Career Investigator Prize (2013) among others. She is also an elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (2023) and Zoological Society of London (2022).

**Abstract:**

Many animal species harbour microbes in their microbiota that suppress pathogen infection. These ‘protective microbes’ can be a significant component of host defence. Through both experimental evolution of multiple microbial systems (e.g., worms, bacteria, viruses) and bioinformatics to track genomic changes, my group has demonstrated that host-associated microbes can drive major changes in pathogen virulence and resistance. Our results indicate that microbes in hosts are important in shaping infection outcomes, now and across evolutionary time.
