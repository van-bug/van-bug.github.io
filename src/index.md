# **Vancouver Bioinformatics User Group**

VanBUG (Vancouver Bioinformatics Users Group) is an association of researchers, other professionals and students in the B.C. Lower Mainland who have an interest in the field of bioinformatics, computational biology, and data sciences. VanBUG meets every month from September through April. Research presentations by bioinformatics leaders, students and industry representatives are followed by networking over pizza and refreshments

[Upcoming meetings](./schedule) will be held monthly on Thursdays from **11:00am to 1:30pm** and are free and open to all. The majority of VanBUG events will now be held simultaneously at UBC's [Michael Smith Laboratories](https://goo.gl/maps/fcU5ji45Fxr39eWq6) and SFU's [Big Data Hub](https://goo.gl/maps/xLFmoRof2hTD2KMP6).
